## Nepenthes

I wrote this to easily track tasks performed throughout the week so that they can be discussed at a weekly on-call handoff meeting.

The only required configuration you will need to do is either create `~/Documents/nepenthes` or edit the DOCROOT variable in `bin/nepenthes` to specify where you want your notes to be stored.

If you would like syntax hilighting in vim, copy the associated files:

`cp -r ./.vim/* ~/.vim/`

Any improvements are welcomed.
